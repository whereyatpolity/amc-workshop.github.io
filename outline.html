<li>Give an overview of what’s going to happen (1 min)</li>

<li>just want to get an idea of why people are attending</li>
<li>Who has used Github before? What about a git GUI? git command line too?</li>
<li>Who here is a programmer or wants to learn to code?</li>
<li>Who here wants to work on free or open source software? (whether in programming, design, testing, documentation, translation, whatever…)</li>
<li>(Thinking maybe if people are mostly wanting to learn git as part of learning to code or contribute to open source, we could lean just a little more on a conceptual understanding of how git works, to prepare for more advanced usage. If people are mostly just curious about what this git thing is and how they can use it, then that is just distracting.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-git-for-10-mins">What is git for? (10 mins)</h2>
